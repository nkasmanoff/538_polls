This is a fairly straightforward code I made in Python that checks fivethirthyeight's daily updates to different polls from around the country, and integrates that result with a trial I have from twilio that allows me to sends those updates to my phone. By further using the crontab feature in terminal, I've set this to run automatically every day, at a time I specified in crontab.
