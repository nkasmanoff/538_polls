This is a fairly straightforward code I made in Python that checks fivethirthyeight's daily poll updates (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/), and integrates that result with a trial account I have from twilio that allows me to sends those updates to my phone. By further using the crontab feature in terminal, I've set this to run automatically every day. Kinda useful automation process, and a good to have these handy in case someone asks what the current polls are!
